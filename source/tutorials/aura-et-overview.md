title: Expense Tracker App - Overview
---
## Overview

In this example you will build an Expense Tracker app that allows you to add expenses, see list of expenses, mark expenses as reimbursed etc.

The goal of the app is to take advantage of many of the components Aura provides out-of-the-box, and to demonstrate the client and server interactions using JavaScript and Apex. As you build the app, youâ€™ll learn how to use Aura expressions to interact with data dynamically and use events to communicate data between components.
